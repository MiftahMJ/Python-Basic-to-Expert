 **Guess Game**

Welcome to the Guess Game!

The objective of the game is simple:
1. You need to guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. The game will provide feedback to help you guess correctly:
   - If your guess is too low, you'll be prompted to guess a higher number.
   - If your guess is too high, you'll be prompted to guess a lower number.
3. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!

Good luck and have fun!
