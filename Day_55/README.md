**Flask Number Guessing Game**

 **Description**

This Flask web application is a simple number guessing game where the server randomly generates a number between 0 and 9.
Users can guess the number by entering their guess directly in the URL. 
The application then responds with a message indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
The response is visually enhanced with different text colors to indicate the result of the guess.
This project demonstrates the basics of Flask routing, random number generation, and dynamic HTML responses.
