**Coffee Machine Simulator**

**Description**

This Coffee Machine Simulator project is a Python-based program that mimics the functionality of a coffee vending machine. Users can order different types of coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino) and pay with virtual coins. The program manages resources, processes payments, and checks if there are sufficient ingredients to make the chosen beverage. The key features include:

**Menu Selection:** Users can choose from three coffee options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

**Resource Management:** The machine checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee) to make the selected drink.

**Coin Processing:** Users insert virtual coins, and the machine calculates the total amount inserted.

**Transaction Validation:** The machine checks if the inserted money is sufficient and returns change if necessary.

**Report Generation:** The machine can print a report showing the remaining resources and total profit.

This project is a great way to practice Python programming, focusing on functions, loops, conditionals, and user interaction. It's suitable for beginners looking to improve their coding skills with a fun and practical project.
